# Knowledge Check!

##Review

Here’s what we’ve learned so far:

1. We made a program with a single file in it.
2. This file has a “namespace” called MyFirstApp, which was created automatically for us.
3. This “namespace” has a _class _inside of it called Program.
4. The Program class has a function inside of it called Main(). It just so happens that the computer knows to “call” the main function when you run the program, so this is like the “entry point” for the program.
5. We added two lines of code inside the main function.
