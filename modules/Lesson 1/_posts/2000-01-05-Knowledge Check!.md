# Knowledge Check!
Hereâ€™s a summary of what we learned in this lesson:
1. How to install Visual Studio and setup a simple Console Application
2. How code consists of *Data* and *Statements*
3. How to use the Console.WriteLine() command to print text to the console output window
4. About Visual Studio's "Intellisense" feature
5. About "Dot Syntax" where you can access commands by using the . character (ex: Console.WriteLine(), Console.ReadLine())

# Class Discussion

1. **What is Visual Studio and why do we use it?**
    * _This question helps students understand the role of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in programming._

2. **Where are you storing your projects on your computer's hard drive?**
    * _This question should spark some discussion about how to find projects and get students thinking about organizing early._

3. **Can anyone explain what a Console Application is?**
    * _This question is aimed at understanding if students grasp the concept of a console application._

4. **What does `Console.WriteLine()` do in a C# program?**
    * _Students should be able to explain that it prints out a line of text to the console._

5. **How would you explain "dot syntax" to a friend who isn't in this class?**
    * _This question tests students' understanding of dot syntax and their ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms._

6. **Can someone give an example of where we used "dot syntax" in our code today?**
    * _This question tests students' ability to recognize and apply what they've learned about dot syntax._

7. **In our "Hello, World!" program, what would happen if we wrote `Console.Write()` instead of `Console.WriteLine()`?**
    * _This question helps students understand the difference between these two methods and how they affect the output of the program._

8. **What was the most challenging part of setting up and creating your first console application in Visual Studio?**
    * _This question gives students an opportunity to express any difficulties they had and allows for troubleshooting and further learning._

9. **How did it feel to write and run your first piece of code?**
    * _This open-ended question allows students to reflect on their experience and share their feelings about coding._

10. **Can anyone think of a real-world application where console applications might be used?**
    * _This question helps students make connections between what they're learning and real-world applications of programming._


# Projects
 
***1. ASCII Art***
1. Make a new Console application called "ASCII_ART"
2. Use a series of Console.WriteLine() statements to draw different shapes to the console output window using characters and spaces. Keep in mind you can use spaces in your output!
Try to draw a square, a triangle, and a circle.
