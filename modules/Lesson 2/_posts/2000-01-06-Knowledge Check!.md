# Knowledge Check!
Here's a summary of what we learned in this lesson:
1. About the concept of Variables for representing 'data' in our programs.
2. About 'int' and 'float' variable types for numbers.
3. About 'boolean' aka 'bool' variables for true/false values.
4. About operators: + (add), - (subtract), *(multiply), and / (divivde)
5. Putting it all together into a 'madlib' program

# Class Discussion

1. **What is a variable in C# and why is it important?**
 * _This question should encourage students to discuss the role of a program having 'memory'_

2. **Can you give examples of when you might use an 'int' variable? How about a 'bool'?**
* _This is a fun question for students, take some time and let them imagine how to represent different type of of real-world values using these types_

3. **What is an operator in the context of programming and can you give examples of some common operators?**

4. **What does the `Console.ReadLine()` function do and how might you use it in a program?**

5. **How did we use variables in our Madlib project?**

6. **Why is it important to choose the correct variable type for the data you want to store?**

7. **What happens if you try to perform an operation with incompatible variable types (like adding a string and an int)?**
* _This is a tricky question because the results can depend on the types used in an expression. Ecourage students to try it and find an answer to the question in the class!_*
