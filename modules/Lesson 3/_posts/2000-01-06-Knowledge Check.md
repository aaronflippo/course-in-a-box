Here's a summary of what we learned in this lesson:
1. About the concept of Variables for representing 'data' in our programs.
2. About 'int' and 'float' variable types for numbers.
3. About 'boolean' aka 'bool' variables for true/false values.
4. About operators: + (add), - (subtract), *(multiply), and / (divivde)
5. Putting it all together into a 'madlib' program

# Class Discussion

1. **What is a function in C#, and why are they important in programming?**

2. **Can you describe the structure of a function in C#?**

3. **What does it mean for a function to 'return' a value, and why might this be useful?**

4. **How do you 'call' a function in your code?**

5. **What are function parameters, and how do they work?**

6. **Can you give an example of a built-in function we used, and explain what it does?**

7. **Why do you think functions are often used in programming instead of writing all code in a linear way?**

8. **What was the most challenging part of writing your own functions?**

9. **How can understanding and using functions make your code more efficient or easier to read?**
