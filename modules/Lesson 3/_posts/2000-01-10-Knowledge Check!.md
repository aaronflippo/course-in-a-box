title: "Coding Challenge: Refactoring with Functions"
--- 
### Coding Challenge

Now that you have all of this newfound power that functions offer, here's a challenge for you: Go back to your "madlib" program from lesson 2, and use functions to simplify it.
1. Identify patterns of statements that you repeat a lot, such as querying the user for a particular input
2. Write a function to do that thing, using parameters and return values.
3. Replace your statements with calls to those functions.

This process of going back and improving old code is called "Refactoring".
