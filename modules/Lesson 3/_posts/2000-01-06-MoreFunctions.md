# More Functions
Functions are *super* important in code, so we're going to practice writing a few more! For a lot of students, the whole concept of a function will seem pretty fuzzy at this point, but with a little practice, it'll all click.

### Exercise 1:
Write the following functions, along with some statements that call each of them:
1. A function that asks the user how old they are, then then tells them (by printing to the console) how old they'll be in 5 years. This function doesn't need to have any input parameter or return value.
2. A function that takes two int parameters called A and B, ads them together, and prints the sum to the console
3. A function that takes two float parameters called A and B, multiplies them together, and returns the product.
4. A function that takes two number parameters and returns the average of the two.
5. A function that takes two number parameters, and returns true if the first is larget than the second..

### Exercise 2:
Revisit your Madlib program from the last lesson, and use functions to handle the user prompting, usinng colored text for the prompts. This should make your program quite a bit shorter, and it will look nicer too!

How do you feel about going back to your old code and improving it like that?
