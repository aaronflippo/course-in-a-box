# Discussion Questions for Lesson 5

In this lesson, we've introduced the concept of classes in C# and object-oriented programming. Let's deepen our understanding with some discussion questions.

1. **What does 'control flow' mean, and what are some examples?**

2. **What is a 'boolean operator' and what are some examples?**

3. **What do if() statements and while() loops have in common?**

4. **What are some things that you can do with loops that can't be done with simple if() statements?**

5. **Can you think of some examples from apps you use (or games you play) that use loops?**
